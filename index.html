                                <p>The reason i chose a lion as my picture is because it is the king of the jungle and also my favorite animal. A lion is always going to be the king, I plan to be the best at anything for as long as i live. The lion is also known for being a very social animal within its pride. This the reason i chose the lion because it is strong and it stands its ground and it can also be very social. </p>

                                    <p>Alittle about myself is that i am a very hard working person, i do not mind working for a long time span. I started working at a young age which built my endurandce up on working in most environments, if there is any job opportunities that are offered to me i take them because i like having new experiences and helping out anyone. If any of my family or friends needed someone to help them fix around there household or even work in food vending they ask me because i have enough experience to start up there process.</p>
